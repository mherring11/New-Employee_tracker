## Description

  A **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem solution for managing a company's employees using Node.js, the Inquirer npm package and a MySQL database.  A bootcamp coding assignment, my challenge was to build this app from scratch with only a MySQL schema as reference. Application also utilizes the following NPM packages: Figlet, Chalk and console.table.

```

npm install
